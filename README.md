# PFR-MWM (STILL WORKING)
Annual project at Telecom Paris with MWM. The goal is to develop a framework that creates a music video automatically given video shots and a music.

## Introduction:

This report aims to summarize our work within the framework of the fil rouge project of the BGD/IA specialized master's degree. The project was proposed by Music World Media (MWM), a company specialized in developing mobile and tablet applications, as well as connected objects in the field of music. The goal is to develop the algorithmic part of an automatic video editing application.

As part of the development of a new mobile application, MWM needs an algorithm to create an automatic video editing based on video clips and music. The objective is to minimize user interactions with the application. The value proposition for this project is to "provide the user with a professional quality video in one click". To achieve this, MWM wants us to use machine learning models.

This project consists of three main axes:

Musical axis: Audio processing to extract useful information for video editing
Video axis: Establishing an interest score on video segments to rank the best segments for video editing
Editing axis: Use the information from the previous two axes to create a professional quality video.
There is also a fourth bonus axis: optimization for mobile devices. As the application is intended for mobile devices, the algorithms we develop should ideally be able to run on mobile devices. MWM emphasized that this objective is a bonus and that the priority is to obtain effective algorithms without taking into account the execution platform.
